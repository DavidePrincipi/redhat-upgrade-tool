TODO
====

_(ordered by priority, roughly)_

Logging::
  * Log the disk layout (lvs, pvs, blkid, fstab, mounts) in debug log
  * Use yum's console output for downloads (see bug #981819)
  ** Or at least show download speed / ETA

Commandline behavior::
  * Write sys.argv into config file
  ** use `fedup --continue` to repeat last run
  ** use `fedup --abort` to delete stored args and remove bootloader config
  * Don't mess with bootloader unless specifically requested
  * At end of upgrade: ``Run 'fedup --reboot' to begin upgrade''
  ** and/or `fedup --start`

Crash handling::
  * Log state to a file
  * Display error message, wait for keypress, then reboot:
  ** "The upgrade failed. Your system has not been harmed. Press <Enter> to
      restart your system."
  ** Allow reboot-on-failure (e.g. for remote systems)

Upgrade lock::
  * If /etc/yum/vars/releasever exists, complain to user (#908017)

Safety checks::
  * Count/report packages without updates/obsoletes
  * Report packages with missing deps

Disk space handling::
  * Pad RPM diskspace check to require more disk
  * Add `--packagedir` and `--cachedir` flags

ISO/Device/"Offline" upgrades::
  * Handle ISO-on-USB-stick case
  * Handle mount chains deeper than ISO-on-USB

Updates::
  * Scheme for associating updates images with upgrade.img vintages

GUI::
  * Wire up the UI bits
  * Wire up progress callbacks
  ** yum in a subprocess
  *** use `multiprocessing.Queue` to send back progress data?

Migration::
  * Add a _fedup-before-upgrade_ scriptlet hook
  ** Not technically a dracut hook, since it'll be run by fedup
  ** Example uses:
  *** https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=881624[Bug #881624]:
      Migrate `KEYTABLE=...` to `KEYMAP=...`
  *** https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=881670[Bug #881670]:
      Add x-systemd.device-timeout=0 for mounts that need it

Legacy systems::
  * Backport to Python 2.6
  ** argparse not in standard lib
  * Backport to upstart

Updates::
  * Figure out updates.img format
  * Look for updates.img
  * Apply it before switch-root

Docs::
  * man pages for services
  * man pages for targets
  * document boot args

Upstreaming::
  * systemd: get system-upgrade.target, system-upgrade-generator upstream
  ** Parallel with http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/SystemUpdates/

SELinux::
  * Find a way to run upgrade with SELinux enforcing
  . Start with new policy while in initramfs
  . Enforce the old policy after switching to old system
  . Use the new policy for writing files during upgrade
